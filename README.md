## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms, implemented in various programming languages. Whether you're a student, developer, or simply interested in learning more about DSA, you'll find useful resources and code samples here.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

Each data structure folder contains:
- An implementation file.
- A README file with explanations and usage examples.
- Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

### Graph Algorithms

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Search Algorithm

### Other Algorithms

- Dynamic Programming (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem)
- Greedy Algorithms (e.g., Coin Change Problem, Activity Selection)
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

Each algorithm folder contains:
- An implementation file.
- A README file with explanations and usage examples.
- Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Setup and Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/samantsu01/ds-and-a.git
    cd dsa-repository


2. **Install dependencies** (if any):
    - For Java, you might need to set up a Java Development Kit (JDK).
    - For Python, you might need to create a virtual environment and install required packages:
      bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run any data structure or algorithm, navigate to the respective directory and run the implementation file. For example, to run the insertion sort implementation in Java:
